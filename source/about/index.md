Hello, I am a PhD student in [Data Intelligence Lab](http://59.111.103.237:8081/) of Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Lidan Shou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/should). I am visiting ETH Zurich now, where I am advised by [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/members/ce-zhang.html).

I work on Natural Language Processing. More specifically, my research interests lie in Efficient Algorithms for NLP (both training and inference), Information Extraction, and NLP in low-resource scenarios. If you want to get in touch, please [send me an email](mailto:zjuwangjue@gmail.com). 

My [resume](resume-Jue.Wang.pdf).
