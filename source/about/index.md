Hello, I am a PhD student in [Data Intelligence Lab](http://59.111.103.237:8081/) of Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Lidan Shou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/should). I am visiting ETH Zurich now, where I am advised by [Prof. Ce Zhang](https://ds3lab.inf.ethz.ch/members/ce-zhang.html).

I work on Natural Language Processing. More specifically, my research interests lie in Efficient Algorithms for NLP (e.g., Knowledge Distillation and Network Pruning), Information Extraction (e.g., Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction), and NLP in low-resource scenarios (e.g., Weak/Semi-Supervised Learning). If you want to get in touch, please [send me an email](mailto:zjuwangjue@gmail.com).
