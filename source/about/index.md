# Jue Wang

Hello, I am currently a second-year MS student in [Data Intelligence Lab](http://59.111.103.237:8081/) of Zhejiang University. I am also an engineering student (Double Degree) at CentraleSupelec. I am advised by [Prof. Lidan Shou](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/should) at Zhejiang University.

I work on Natural Language Processing and Data Mining. More specifically, my research interests lie in Information Extraction such as Named Entity Recognition Knowledge Extraction etc., Weak/Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm and other nlp-related problems as well as AI more broadly. If you are looking to get in touch, please [send me an email](mailto:zjuwangjue@gmail.com). 

I am considering to apply for a Ph.D position, please contact me if you or your team have a vacancy.

My [short CV](resume-Jue.Wang.pdf).

## Research

I am involved in named entity mention recognition. The paper is under submission to ACL2020.

I was previously working on:

*EXACT* project which aims to build a convenient text annotation platform with the help of nlp techniques such as Semi-Supervised Learning, Active Learning, etc.

*SAMIE*: Self-Asking Model for Information Extraction, where we redifine the key phrase extraction problem as a more open problem of dual question-answer extraction and present a semi-supervised model for dual question-answer extraction.
