Hi ~ 我目前是浙江大学数据智能实验室（[Data Intelligence Lab](http://59.111.103.237:8081/)）的博士生，导师是[寿黎但](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/should)教授。

我主要研究 Natural Language Processing 和 Data Mining 相关工作。 具体来说，我的研究兴趣在于 Information Extraction（比如实体识别、关系抽取等），低资源下的NLP（比如弱/半监督学习算法），以及高效NLP算法（比如知识蒸馏等）。可以通过[电子邮件](mailto:zjuwangjue@gmail.com)来联系我。

这是我的[简历](/about/resume-Jue.Wang.pdf)。
